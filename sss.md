# FAQ/SSS

These are some general questions directed at me by my followers/friends or those DMing me.

_As a little side note, "SSS" is Turkish translation of "FAQ" and stands for "SÄ±k Sorulan Sorular"._

## Are you a transgender or AFAB (Assigned Female As Birth)?

I'm a transgender. I have already had sparks of it since I was 10 but my egg cracked open about 2 months ago as of January 15, 2022.

## In what phase of transition are you in?

Well, better have it as a list. Scratched ones are done.

- ~~Awareness~~
- Coming out to your environment (Still in progress, partially done)
- ~~Updating names online~~ (I consider this done even tho there are several leftovers I don't use.)
- Shaving my body (Hopefully when I move out.)
- Getting HRT (Hopefully when I move out.)
- Buying some skirts and dresses (Hopefully when I move out.)

## Is there anything I can help you with if any?

As long as you're not an Android developer or old device maintainer, showing me affection is more than enough. :>

## What is Project Kasumi? Can I use it on my device?

Project Kasumi is an Android project Yuki has founded and I develop, aiming to be a new home for weebs while providing minimal customization on top of Lineage/AOSP.

For using it on your device, of course you can! All you need the requirement of your device to have **public** sources, the rest is on me.

And if you're a device maintainer, just head over to https://git.polycule.co/ProjectKasumi/android/manifest.git and build yourself. :P

## Are you really following NSFW accounts unconditionally?

Well, not really. I follow them only if they follow me or work on another branch that got my attention - For example as a vtuber or some tech related stuff.

## I'm looking for xxx, can you help me?

Please ask this type of questions in groups. I'm not your personal support. You can send private info if there's any in my PMs though, it's okay.
