### Just a YouTuber doing something weird.

A multifunctional programmer working on different stuff like scripting, modding and many more.

Pinned repositories are mostly Android stuff.

Head of <a href="https://github.com/teos-dev">teos-dev</a> and developer of <a href="https://github.com/Stellar-Weeb">Stellar OS Weeb Edition</a>.

I also work at amyROM as RHM (Right Hand Man), Stellar OS as Seed maintainer and GNU/Weeb as tester.

Don't forget to embrace E-mpire. >:3
